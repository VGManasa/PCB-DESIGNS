# ULN2803 Relay Card PCB

## Overview

This project is an **8-channel relay card** built around the **ULN2803A Darlington transistor array**, designed in **KiCad 9**.  

The primary purpose of this board is to allow **low-power control signals** from a microcontroller, Arduino, or logic circuit to safely control **high-power electrical devices** that cannot be driven directly by the control electronics. These devices can include motors, solenoids, lamps, or other inductive or resistive loads that require higher current or voltage than the microcontroller can supply.  

Each of the 8 relays on the card can be **individually controlled** by sending a digital HIGH or LOW signal to its corresponding input. When a control signal is applied:

1. The ULN2803A amplifies the low-current input signal using its Darlington transistor array.  
2. This amplified current energizes the relay coil, creating a magnetic field.  
3. The magnetic field closes the relay contacts, connecting the high-power circuit and turning on the external device.  

The board also includes **several protective features** to ensure reliable operation in real-world applications:

- **Reverse polarity protection** prevents damage if the power supply is connected backwards.  
- **Overcurrent protection** prevents excessive current from damaging the board or relays.  
- **Transient voltage suppression** protects the electronics from voltage spikes caused by switching inductive loads.  
- **Decoupling capacitors** stabilize the supply voltage, preventing relay chatter and noise during switching events.  


The base schematic and PCB design were inspired by the **ElectroTech CC KiCad ULN2803 Relay Card tutorial**:

All enhancements and modifications listed below were implemented independently.

## Modifications Implemented by Manasa

The original ULN2803 relay card design was functional, but to improve **reliability, protection, and performance**, the following modifications were made:

1. **Schottky diode in series at VCC input**  
   - Protects the board from **reverse polarity connections**.  
   - Schottky was chosen for its **low voltage drop**, ensuring relays still get enough voltage to operate correctly.

2. **Polyfuse (resettable fuse) at VCC input**  
   - Safeguards against **overcurrent and short circuits**, preventing damage to the PCB and relays.  
   - Unlike a normal fuse, it **resets automatically**, improving safety without replacing components.

3. **TVS (Transient Voltage Suppression) diode across VCC–GND**  
   - Protects sensitive components from **voltage spikes or transients** caused by relay switching or external disturbances.  
   - Ensures the ULN2803 IC and other components are **safe from sudden voltage surges**.

4. **47µF electrolytic capacitor across VCC–GND at input**  
   - Smooths input voltage and **reduces ripple**, especially when multiple relays switch at once.  
   - Prevents unintended relay chatter due to momentary dips in VCC.

5. **100µF electrolytic capacitor at ULN2803 VCC**  
   - Provides **bulk decoupling** to supply sufficient current to all 8 relays simultaneously.  
   - Ensures stable operation during **high inrush currents** when multiple relays activate at the same time.

6. **100nF ceramic capacitor in parallel with 100µF**  
   - Handles **high-frequency noise** that the electrolytic capacitor cannot filter.  
   - Essential for **suppressing EMI/RFI** generated by relay switching and protecting sensitive electronics.

7. **PWR_FLAG components added in KiCad**  
   - Marks the VCC and GND nets as **valid power sources**.  
   - Clears ERC errors and ensures KiCad correctly understands the **power flow in the schematic**.

8. **All DRC and ERC errors cleared**  
   - Guarantees a **manufacturable, error-free PCB**, reducing the risk of production failures.  
   - Confirms the design meets industry-standard **electrical and layout rules**.

**Impact of these enhancements:**  

These modifications collectively make the relay card **more robust, reliable, and safe** for real-world use. They address common issues such as:

- Accidental reverse polarity connections  
- Short circuits and overcurrent conditions  
- Voltage spikes from relay switching  
- Noise and voltage dips affecting relay operation  
- High inrush current stability  
- Correct power recognition for design verification  

This ensures that the PCB can **operate safely and reliably** in any electronics or robotics project, even under demanding conditions.
